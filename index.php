          I was taken away from my family like all the children in the world.
          I was raised in a special government facility managed by the “fairy”, an AI system, which aims to produce the perfect human race.
          The system taught me everything but I always knew there was something missing. Until one day…

          I saw my first human being; he was an engineer working for the “fairy” who came to fix something in my cell.
          What I did not know was that he was undercover fighting against this cruel inhumane system.
          I had found what was missing in my life. I had fallen in love with him.

          We found a way to let him in to the cell, which could only be opened from outside with my DNA sample.
          That’s why I had to put a piece of my long blond hair into the ventilation system so he could use to access the cell.

          We were under strict surveillance. The “fairy” found out about us! They cut my hair, and kicked me
          out of the facility to an unknown place. The other humans called it the “Ghetto”. This is the place where
          the unwanted humans and imperfect children lived

          Fairy tricked my love by using the hair that was cut from me. When he entered the cell, he was captured and then
          tortured by robots for months. Barely alive, the “fairy” sent him into the “Ghetto” where I was.

          One day, in the deepest corner of the Ghetto, I found him lying on the ground.
          For months, I treated his wounds. We were finally back together but we knew there were more people to rescue.
          That´s why we chose to fight back.
