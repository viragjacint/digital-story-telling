    <p>Do you know who I am? I am Rapunzel. I am sure you have heard of me.
      Whatever you heard is a lie, let me tell you the true story.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- chapter-two -->
  <div class="chapter-two w3-container w3-content w3-center w3-padding-300" id="chapter-two">
    <p>I was taken away from my family like all the children in the world.
      I was raised in a special government facility managed by the “fairy”, an AI system, which aims to produce the perfect human race.
      The system taught me everything but I always knew there was something missing. Until one day…</p>
  </div>

  <!-- chapter-three -->
  <div class="chapter-three w3-container w3-content w3-center w3-padding-300" id="chapter-three">
    <p>I saw my first human being; he was an engineer working for the “fairy” who came to fix something in my cell.
      What I did not know was that he was undercover fighting against this cruel inhumane system.
      I had found what was missing in my life. I had fallen in love with him.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- chapter-four -->
  <div class="chapter-four w3-container w3-content w3-padding-300" style="max-width:800px" id="chapter-four">
    <p>4-	We found a way to let him in to the cell, which could only be opened from outside with my DNA sample.
      That’s why I had to put a piece of my long blond hair into the ventilation system so he could use to access the cell.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- chapter-five -->
  <div class="chapter-five w3-container w3-content w3-padding-300" style="max-width:800px" id="chapter-five">
    <p>We were under strict surveillance. The “fairy” found out about us! They cut my hair, and kicked me
      out of the facility to an unknown place. The other humans called it the “Ghetto”. This is the place where
      the unwanted humans and imperfect children lived</p>
  </div>

  <!-- chapter-six -->
  <div class="chapter-six w3-container w3-content w3-padding-300" style="max-width:800px" id="chapter-six">
    <p>Fairy tricked my love by using the hair that was cut from me. When he entered the cell, he was captured and then
      tortured by robots for months. Barely alive, the “fairy” sent him into the “Ghetto” where I was.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- chapter-seven -->
  <div class="chapter-seven w3-container w3-content w3-padding-300" style="max-width:800px" id="chapter-seven">
    <p>One day, in the deepest corner of the Ghetto, I found him lying on the ground.
      For months, I treated his wounds. We were finally back together but we knew there were more people to rescue.
      That´s why we chose to fight back.</p>
